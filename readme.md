# PHP web framework

Generic PHP web framework for creating web sites

## Setup your project

Start a new empty git project. Clone the framework as a submodule in your project:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dannyvanderpol/php_web_framework.git framework
```

Instead of framework` you can also use another name.

Create a new `index.php` in the root of your project and add the following lines:

```
<?php

include("framework/index.php);

```

Save the file.

Read the git manual about submodules for more information about working with sub modules (https://www.google.com/search?q=git+submodules).
